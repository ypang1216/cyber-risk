			<h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Methodology</h2>
			
			<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-3">Risk Segmentation Framework</h3>
			<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
				Our risk segmentation framework is built on analyzing five key risk categories that are particularly relevant to startups:
			</p>
			
			<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
				<li><span class="font-medium">Data Breach Risk:</span> Evaluation of your data security practices, the sensitivity of data you handle, and your vulnerability to breaches.</li>
				<li><span class="font-medium">Ransomware Exposure:</span> Assessment of your susceptibility to ransomware attacks based on your technology infrastructure and backup practices.</li>
				<li><span class="font-medium">Third-party Vendor Risk:</span> Analysis of the security posture of your critical vendors and service providers.</li>
				<li><span class="font-medium">Employee Security Risk:</span> Evaluation of security awareness among your team and vulnerability to social engineering attacks.</li>
				<li><span class="font-medium">Cloud Security Risk:</span> Assessment of your cloud infrastructure security configuration and compliance.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3 class="text-lg font-medium mb-3">Data Sources</h3>
			<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
				Our risk assessments are powered by multiple data sources:
			</p>
			
			<ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
				<li>Industry benchmarking data from over 10,000 companies</li>
				<li>Historical cyber incident data from various sectors</li>
				<li>Security questionnaire responses</li>
				<li>External vulnerability scan results (optional)</li>
				<li>Company size, industry, and technology profile information</li>
